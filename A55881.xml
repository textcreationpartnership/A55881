         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough the whole <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God are dear to me, and after whoſe Conſolation I am greatly long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet you are the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <pb facs="tcp:44357:3"/>all others with whom I have been moſt concerned, and unto whom I am moſt engaged, and therefore to you chiefly do I dedicate theſe my ſmall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; who though I have been a long time in Congregational Union with one of you, yet my growth in the moſt true Divinity is very ſmall; for when I was in the chief of natural Perfections, and being of low Stature, and climbing a Tree to ſee <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> like <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi> my feet ſlipping, thereby I got a dangerous fall, and you, though you uſed all the means you could deviſe for my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, yet it proved all in vain, till at laſt Addreſſing your ſelves to the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, after many Prayers and Tears were made and ſpent, you obtained an anſwer of Peace; but it was to me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by ſuch terrible things in Righteouſneſs, that it left ſuch deep impreſſes on my Soul, the <pb facs="tcp:44357:3"/>which laſting time can hardly declare, yet I being very weak in my Spirit, and unfit for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it pleaſed the wiſe Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Souls to retire me for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Seven Years, into a den of Darkneſs, and a place of many dangers and difficulties, where I lived by ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as your earneſt Prayers procured for me of the Father of Mercies; at laſt after many a dangerous wound by the ſting of the fiery Serpent, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which being known to God and me, this longed-for Trumpet of Jubilee was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſounded in mine ears, <hi>viz. Tell her that her War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is accompliſhed;</hi> yet I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in this retirement for ſome time after, and then at length obtained a full releaſe; but much of the ſhining droſs of this World, together with the deforming Leproſie of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, was happily left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me; but then I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb facs="tcp:44357:4"/>leave that Society of
<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> with whom my Spirit was now ſo deeply intangled, and having obtained leave of you, I abode with them; the iſſue of which, was to me a ſtate of joy and trouble; for when I beheld you, O ye my dear Friends of
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſaulted by the ſeat of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I almoſt diſpaired of your ſecurity, and fell for a ſeaſon into ſuch a fainting ſtate, that I had but little natural ſtrength left in my Body; yet obtained help of God by ſtrong aſſaults at the Throne of Grace, and you and I came out of that Tribulation with little inward or outward damage. But Satan began to work, againſt us ſome other way, by which both I and ſome of you were ſore wounded in the houſe of our Friends, the which I greatly deſired might ſtill be born with a Chriſtian calmneſs, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained my deſire herein, as <pb facs="tcp:44357:4"/>the event did ſhew, therefore ſome of you giving way to the unruly Spirit of <hi>Belial,</hi> he let in divers other Spirits into your Souls, till ſome of you became dangerouſly intangled in the Spirit of Apoſtacy, and others of you ſtood tottering in great dimneſs and ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which ſunk me down into a ſecond and more great diſpair, for when I ſaw the Weeds grow ſo faſt, and there was no way to root them out, I ſorely feared the whole Field would be forſaken for them; but at laſt the workers of Iniquity began to go to their own place, and ſo the little Children had a little relief. And while we were thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in <hi>Pihahiroth,</hi> in the Mountains of Straits, I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned, and at laſt conſented to write down the ſum and ſubſtance of my belief about thoſe things our Mothers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Children had me in ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <pb facs="tcp:44357:5"/>but while <hi>I</hi> was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about theſe things, ſome things fell out concerning ſome perſons, which made me like <hi>Moſes,</hi> break the Tables, and ſo this enſuing Treatiſe lay almoſt aſleep for a good while; yet I had many fears in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by reaſon of my neglect herein, both before and after I came to
<hi>Leiceſter</hi> Priſon, where now by the Grace of God, in the midſt of ſome diſtractions, I have at laſt finiſhed this brief deſcription of the eſtate of the true Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it was by reaſon of you, O ye my dear Friends of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> that I was firſt caſt into theſe parts, by whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity alſo, at laſt theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers have been compleated, you muſt needs be taken into the number of thoſe to whom they are now dedicated, for you have been and ſtill are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear to me; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, <hi>I</hi> have had more than
<pb facs="tcp:44357:5"/>ordinary experience of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy, both in natural and ſpiritual things, even at all times, and have felt great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by your Prayers, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, both to Soul and Body; therefore I cannot but eſteem and prefer you with thoſe Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties with whom <hi>I</hi> have had more long acquaintance, unto whom, all of you together, do I preſent theſe the firſt fruits of my poor endeavours; deſiring you to make the beſt conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, and carefully to weigh and conſider, before you approve or reject ought you find therein. And now the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching God, that tryeth the Heart and all things, knoweth my end in theſe Papers, and I have declared it in part in the Epiſtle to the Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and do yet again profeſs to you, that I deſire as well as <hi>I</hi> can, the glory of God, the advantage of Truth, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ſatisfaction of Souls,
<pb facs="tcp:44357:6"/>the which <hi>I</hi> beſeech the Father of Mercies to bring to paſs; and though <hi>I</hi> have been as one of the feeble, and as a Tree ſhaken with the wind among you, yet have I not kept back ought that
<hi>I</hi> had from you, that I judged might have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the good of your Souls; but like one of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, have been ready upon all occaſions to talk with you touching thoſe things which concerns our Fathers Kingdom, the which being a land of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances unto many of us, we have ſhewed our ſelves to be like that Man whoſe eyes
<hi>Jeſus</hi> had almoſt opened, and ſo could ſee Men but ſeem to walk as Trees, and we have yet need, notwithſtanding all our great confidence, to be crying to the Lord for a ſecond Touch, that all the ſcales might fall from our Eyes; and I do know well that <hi>I</hi> have but a dim Sight, and <pb facs="tcp:44357:6"/>a ſtamering Tongue, it is too much to be doubted that others alſo are ſomewhat dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and from hence it might and yet may ariſe, that our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Children have had ſome occaſion to be angry with me; however I am greatly inclined to ſtill them as well as I can, ſo that I may keep Truth from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Streets, and a good Conſcience from being violated by any means. And you may plainly percieve that I have no end at my own glory in theſe things, in that I have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to beautifie it at all with humane wiſdom, but with great ſimplicity as becomes the Title it preſents it ſelf to view. Neither do I mind mine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profit by any thing that is now undertaken, my mind being but little enclined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ever ſince you and I have had to do one with another. And by reaſon of many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impediments, both pains <pb facs="tcp:44357:7"/>and loſs are like to be my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent rewards, and you are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and God alſo, that I have coveted no mans Gold, or Silver, or Apparel, though I migt have had all theſe from you with right true deſire, but theſe hands for the moſt part, through the good providence of God, hitherto miniſtred unto my neceſſities, and ſo what I have freely received, I would freely give again, deſiring the Ever Bleſſed God to make all my poor endeavours, as the wilderneſs-Feaſt of Barly Bread and Fiſhes, which was bleſſed for the nouriſhment of very many Souls. So not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to burden you too much, nor too long to detain you from the things that follow, I deſire earneſtly the continuance of your ſerious requeſts for me, as <hi>I</hi> hope mine will be ſtill for you,</p>

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Of holding the Mortality of the Soul, and denying the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body from the Dead, or ſomething equivalent thereunto; ſometimes ſuſpected of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> of Praying to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Juſtification by Works, and ſuch like things, which ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious minds could frame; All which things he hath ſometimes born with much calmneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thinking it ſufficient that <pb facs="tcp:44357:8"/>his own Conſcience hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him innocent as to things of this nature, and alſo rejoyceth in Divine Grace, by which he hath been kept in ſuch a ſtate, although full of imperfections, as that occaſion hath not been given to the accuſed, or much ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of an impious Life; yet for the ſake of the poor in Spirit, his only companions, and which are very dear unto him, he hath given forth a brief declaration of the Chriſtian Faith, Order and Life, in the which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expects to be ſaved; and his deſign is to further the good and benefit of all ſerious Souls, who in very many toſſings to and fro, have almost been tired and diſcouraged on the Mountains of Wandring; but yet this is not all: for he would fain awaken the Careleſs Daughters, and give a Midnight-Cry to the Fooliſh Virgins, that if poſſible, they might ſee the Bed of Chriſtian-Profeſſion to be too ſhort, and <pb facs="tcp:44357:9"/>the Covering of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be too narrow to reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in, from that Heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God with whom we all muſt ſhortly have to do: But the Author did firſt intend to have left this little Treatiſe in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript only to three Societies, with whom he hath been more than ordinarily concerned; the which, though little in Bulk, is great in Matter, and contains that which might have been the Subject of many great Volumes, it relating to the whole Myſtery of Godlineſs from firſt to laſt, the which, without controverſie, is exceeding great; and it is deſigned to be promoted by the Author, as his poor Abilities will afford, not only in the Theory thereof, but alſo in the practical Part, which is indeed the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of true Divinity; and though it may come forth in a Name and Title ſomewhat ſtrange at first, yet when the Reaſon thereof is given, it may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <pb facs="tcp:44357:9"/>appear a wonder; for as the Church of Chriſt is ſometimes in Scripture called a City; as in <hi>Pſal. 46.4. There is a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the ſtreams whereof makes glad the City of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Place of the Tabernacle of the moſt High:</hi> So, <hi>Mat, 5.14.</hi> it is ſaid to be the <hi>Salt of the Earth, and a City ſet on a Hill that cannot be hid;</hi> and in <hi>Eph. 2.19. Now therefore ye are no more Strangers and Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but Fellow-Citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi> So alſo there are divers Cities and Towns in Scripture, that do very much repreſent the ſame; among which <hi>Bethania</hi> is no ſmall repreſentation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Hebrew ſignification of it.</p>
            <p>And first it is repreſented by <hi>Zion,</hi> which ſignifieth Drineſs, and ſo indeed ſhe is, with reſpect to her own eſtate, but that the Rivers of the waters of Life from the Rock in the weary Land,
<pb facs="tcp:44357:10"/>
               <hi>Iſa. 32.21.</hi> flow unto her, and is a place of broad Rivers and Streams therein, <hi>Iſa. 33.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſignifying the Viſion of Peace, and indeed this City where Christ the Prince of Peace dwelleth, muſt needs be the eleareſt ſight of Peace on this ſide Heaven it ſelf, and the Peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, <hi>Phil. 4.7.</hi> doth keep the Hearts and Minds of them in perfect Peace, who as the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, do ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly walk by the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Rule, <hi>Gal. 6.16.</hi> Beſides, this City does not only ſee Viſions of Peace from God, but alſo Viſions of Peace are ſeen from it to Men, being <hi>a Kingdom which is not of this World, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. Neither conſiſteth in meat or drink,</hi> Rom. <hi>14.7. but in Righteouſneſs, and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which ſignifies the Houſe of Bread; and in the true Church of Chriſt this <pb facs="tcp:44357:10"/>Bread of Life is the only food of Souls, the which being the fleſh of Chriſt our Life, all the heavenly Off-ſpring live thereby, <hi>John 6.57. He that eateth me, ſhall live by me;</hi> and from hence the Bread of Life is alſo miniſterially ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; <hi>For the Spirit and the Bride ſay Come, and let him that Heareth, ſay Come, and whoſoever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. <hi>22.17.</hi> and ſo <hi>Prov. 9.5. Come eat of my bread, and drink of the Wine which I have mingled.</hi> So Iſa. <hi>55.2 Why do ye ſpend your mony for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But fourthly, by <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> the houſe of Fiſhing, and in this City the Fiſhers of men do dwell, who being crafty with a divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, catch Souls of Men for Christ, and bring them home to their Master. <hi>2 Cor. 12.16.</hi> From hence came that Squadron of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
<pb facs="tcp:44357:11"/>of whom <hi>Merlin</hi> told <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that ſhould enter upon his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories unarmed with Sword or Spear, unto whom all Nations ſhould in time obey, who ſhall deſtroy the Temples of thy Gods, O
<hi>Lucius,</hi> and convert them to the ſervice of their Eternal King. Theſe are alſo skilful in Fiſhing in the great deeps, and find in the Book of Scripture and the book of Nature many precious Jewels.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, by <hi>Timnath-heres,</hi> Judges <hi>2.9.</hi> ſignifiing the image of the Sun, and upon this City doth the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe</hi> and ſhine with great, yet with inviſible Glory, to the World, and to the <hi>careleſs Daughters,</hi> Mal.
<hi>4.2.</hi> and is <hi>a Sun and a Shield</hi> unto it, Pſalm
<hi>84.11.</hi> for this City hath <hi>Truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts,</hi> Pſal.
<hi>51.6.</hi> and is <hi>all glorious within,</hi> Pſal. <hi>45.13.</hi> And as the natural Sun by ſhining through a little crevice into a Houſe, forms his own image on the wall or on the floor, even ſo <pb facs="tcp:44357:11"/>the glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining into the hearts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this City, <hi>2 Cor. 4.6.</hi> forms his own moſt precious Image there, Chap.
<hi>3.18.</hi> from whence the beams of divine vertue ſhine forth to the World; by which they become a light to men.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, by <hi>Bethania,</hi> which in ſeveral languages, as skilful men obſerve, ſignifies divers things, as ſometimes the Houſe of Obedience, and indeed the obedience of Faith is eminently found in this City. Secondly, the Houſe of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of which ſhe is oft partaker, as a ſtate that naturally attends the Goſpel. Thirdly, of the Grace of the Lord, which is the only ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by which this City Works, and Reigns, and Shines. Fourthly, the Houſe of a Song, from the new Song, which by redeemed Souls, is ſung to Jeſus their Saviour, who came to ſave his People from their Sins. But Fifthly, the Houſe of the Poor, from the Hebrew <hi>Bith</hi> and
<hi>Gnania,</hi> from this ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb facs="tcp:44357:12"/>is derived, and this is the true ſtate of the Church of Chriſt, with reſpect to humane excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, being poor in Spirit, but rich in Faith, empty of guile, but full of Sincerity; is become a Fool for Chriſt, in reſpect of Worldly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but wiſe in Chriſt, with that Wiſdom which is from above; ſhe is weak and feeble as the Conies, a feeble folk, <hi>Prov. 30 26.</hi> with reſpect to humane Power, but full of might and Power by the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit of the Lord, <hi>Mic. 3.8.</hi> ſhe is aſhamed of all her own Righteouſneſs, both of nature, and alſo that which is of the Law, it being imperfect by reaſon of the fall, and ſo ſhe accounts it as filthy rags and as a menſtruous cloth, but is full of the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs Chriſt firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to her, and after wrought in her, by his divine Power; yet all her natural glory is wholly vailed, for the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath looked upon her, and ſhe is become black and undone in <pb facs="tcp:44357:12"/>her ſelf, becauſe her eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of Hoſts. <hi>Cant. 1.6. Iſa. 6.5.</hi> but this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty conſiſted not only in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, but alſo in the things of this World, in which ſhe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flouriſheth in uncertain Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor appears in that Pomp and State in which <hi>Babel</hi> ſhines; ſhe ſets light by the unrighteous Mammon of this World, it being the portion of men of earthy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, therefore ſhe is often in Hunger, Thirſt, Cold and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, ſhe hath been Deſtitute, Afflicted and Tormented, hath wandred from one kindred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People, and hath ſeldom any certain dwelling place; oft-times this <hi>Abel</hi> is ſlain by this Cainiſh brood, but like the Phoenix ſhe ſprings again out of her own aſhes, and the gates of Hell do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt her. <hi>Babel</hi> hath Golden Chalices, but Wooden Prieſts; but ſhe is contented with wooden Chalices, and rejoyceth in her golden or ſhining Miniſtery. <pb facs="tcp:44357:13"/>Lo this is that little City which we call <hi>Bethania,</hi> where alſo the poor wiſe man <hi>(Eccl.
9.14.)</hi> is content and delights to dwell, who became poor for our ſakes, that we might be made rich by him, he had not a hole to reſt his head in this World, that we might poſſeſs Eternal Manſions of Glory in the World to come, he left Heaven that we might be redeemed from Hell, came out of the boſome of his Father, that we that were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from it might return. He was crowned with Thorns, that we might obtain by him a Crown of Righteouſneſs and Glory; he was content to bear his Father's wrath, that we might obtain an intereſt in his Eternal Love. In fine be died an accurſed Death, that we might live a Bleſſed Life, ſo that viſible poverty hath been incident to Chriſt and his little City; and it is like to be the Eſtate of his eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin till the Marriage of the Lamb be come, and ſhe be inſtated in his eternal Riches.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44357:13"/>
            <p>But now <hi>Bethania</hi> was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain City or Town almoſt two Miles from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> John <hi>11.16.</hi> ſcituate on the Mount of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,</hi> Mar. <hi>11.1.</hi> and was a Place which Jeſus often viſited; into <hi>Bethania</hi> he went out of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to lodge, after the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had ſung <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> Mat. <hi>21.17.</hi> Near this Place ſtood the Fig-tree which he curſed in his return again into the City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe it bare nothing but leaves. <hi>ver. 9.</hi> It was in
<hi>Bethania</hi> where the Woman anointed Jeſus's feet, <hi>Mat. 26 6.</hi> and <hi>John 12.3.</hi> In this <hi>Bethania</hi> Jeſus mildly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Martha,</hi> and juſtified <hi>Mary</hi> in waiting rather for ſomething from him, than being cumbred with <hi>Martha,</hi> in preparing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, <hi>Luke 10.38, 39, 40, 41, 42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>Bethania</hi> he raiſed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> and wept for Sympathy, <hi>John 11.35, &amp; 43.</hi> In or near <hi>Bethania</hi> he bleſſed his Diſciples, <hi>Luke 24.59.</hi> and from thence <pb facs="tcp:44357:14"/>was taken up into Heaven, <hi>verſ. 57. Acts 1.9, 12.</hi> And to this Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where <hi>Bethania</hi> ſtandeth, Jeſus, for ought appears, may come the ſecond time, as the firſt Place he will viſit in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as being the laſt he left in his Aſcent to Heaven, according to that Prophecy, <hi>Zech. 14.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Bethania</hi> therefore is a clear Repreſentation of the true Church of Chriſt, where his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit revives the otherwiſe dying Souls of men; here he mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproves thoſe who do one good thing, when another more weighty ſhould be attended; in this place and ſtate of poorneſs of Spirit are the ſpiritual Bleſſings enjoyed from Chriſt our Saviour; and here Souls ſit with a weeping <hi>Mary</hi> in great humility at Jeſus his Feet; here Jeſus ſeems to weep through Sympathy with his poor and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted People, and will not forget the Congregation of his poor for ever, <hi>34.19.</hi> This City is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a true Communion of Saints, <pb facs="tcp:44357:14"/>according to that ancient Article of the Apoſtles Creed; and in the fulneſs of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, <hi>Meum</hi> and
<hi>Tuum</hi> are not the native Speech; this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is perfectly compacted and maintained by unfeigned Love, the Bond of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>Col. 3.16.</hi> And where Love abounds, Life, and Goods, and all, will very eaſily go for the Brethren; therefore we long greatly to ſee this Place and State, and often expreſs our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in this manner; <hi>O that the Salvation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were come out of</hi> Sion! And, <hi>Return, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, O</hi> Shulamite, <hi>return, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that we may look upon thee; for the</hi> Shulamite <hi>hath long time dwelt in the Clefts of the Rock, and the ſecret places of the Stairs;</hi> and our Church hath yet recovered but little of her Beauty; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we have found out her Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and out of it collected ſome part of her Divinicy; and it is greatly deſired that all the true <pb facs="tcp:44357:15"/>Sons of <hi>Sion</hi> would leave all their Fury in which they have appeared like a <hi>wild Bull in a Net,</hi>

<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the whole Soul is covered over with the Spirit of God, in which it is to live and walk, and act in Divine Things; and this is true Regeneration; of which the other part is but the Laver.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44357:45"/>therefore to believe and maintain that to be the Church of Chriſt, which is a Communion of Impious and Ungodly Perſons, whether we reſpect Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Congregational Societies, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near of Kin, if not the very ſame with Hereſy; for to father Children on the moſt pure God, which are not of his own Begetting; and to caſt a Spouſe upon his Bleſſed Lamb, that is of a different nature from him, is a very high degree of Indignity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as well as Confuſed <hi>Babel,</hi> are in great danger of being guilty of Herely.

The <hi>Bethanians</hi> divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Parts, and deſire to be found always in that Poſture, in which every one of them may be performed.</p>
               <p>The firſt Part of <hi>Watching</hi> is an Abſtenance from Sleep at ſome times,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Chap.</hi>

It extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Animal Kingdom, and ſo wholly ends in Death, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen any more after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Both the Heathens and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have ſhunned it as much as they could,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8.</note> for it is in the Exceſs thereof, often reproved by an awakened Conſcience. We read of very many Actions of Chriſt, but very little of his ſleeping. Once he was found ſleeping on a Pillow,
<hi>while the Ship was toſſed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi>
4.38.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Diſciples terrified,</hi> but he quickly awoke, and wrought a Miracle. The Goſpel-Miniſters who are appointed by Chriſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Spiritual Sleepers, have been often themſelves Exerciſed in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14.</note> So ſaith
<hi>Paul, In Stripes, in Impriſonments, in Travels, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in Watchings, in Faſtings;</hi> yet further, <hi>in Wearineſs and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt, in Cold and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Therefore, though Sleep be pleaſing and incident to Nature, yet the Croſs of Chriſt doth Crucifie the Superfluity thereof in all true <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the ſecond Degree of <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is a careful obſerving of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of the Soul in all its Exerciſes and Imployments;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.</note> for there be Snares attending upon every State; yea <hi>Eden</hi> it ſelf was not ſecure from them; and <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44357:62"/>ſeeing the Soul is ſo apt to wander, before it is fixed in the immutable State,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.10</note> therefore the Man of God is to be watchful in all things; and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſelf, that moſt ſerious Buſineſs, is carefully to be attended with it. For if the vigilant Enemy cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract us by groſs Corruptions,<note place="margin">2 <hi>John</hi>
8.</note> yet he will endeavour to do it by unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Exerciſes. The Soul that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of an unclean Spirit, being ſwept and garniſhed with many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, may be Re-poſſeſſed again through want of Watchfulneſs, with Seven Spirits worſe than the former. Decayes are incident to all unfixed things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.43.</note> therefore the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> left her firſt Love, unto which ſhe is adviſed again to return,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The Third Part of <hi>Watching,</hi> is an earneſt Expectation of the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all Gods Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;<note place="margin">

               <p>VERTUE is the inward Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Life of every living Form, and is that by which thoſe Forms become profitable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto thoſe by whom they are uſed.</p>
               <p>Vertue is of two kinds, The firſt is <hi>Natural,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Natural Vertue,</hi> is that by which the Flowers in the Fields yeild forth unto men a <hi>Pleaſant Savour,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a
<hi>Medicinal Profit.</hi> By <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertue,</hi> The Fruits of the Fields and Trees do nouriſh and feed the Bodies of Men and Beaſts: And beſides, by <hi>Natural Vertue,</hi> the Needle in the Compaſs, being touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, turneth always towards the <hi>North,</hi> in which the Rocks of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones lye; even ſo alſo, the Vertue of Fire penetrateth into whatſoever things cometh near to it, and changeth the Properties thereof into a Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with its own Nature: it cauſeth cold Water to become hot; ſo that the Fleſh that is boyled therein,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>John</hi> 8.12.</note> is made ſavoury. Cold Iron is changed <pb n="111" facs="tcp:44357:74"/>into a burning State, and therein is capable of being wrought into divers Forms; it is not the Form nor Colour of Salt, for Snow hath both theſe, but the Vertue thereof, which maketh it to be ſo uſeful to the Sons of men. Water hath the ſame liquid Form as Wine, but not the ſame powerful Operation: Therefore the Bodies of men are in that Eſtate, in the Exceſs of Wine, unto which the ſame Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Water will in no wiſe reduce them. So every living Form ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and worketh by Vertue of that Spirit, which is proper to its own Nature; therefore, every Herb, Plant, and Tree, live and work by Vertue of a Vegetative Spirit; ſo the Beaſts Fowls, and Fiſhes, and Creeping Things, live by Vertue of a Senſitive Spirit; alſo all Angels and Souls of men, live immortal Lives, by Vertue of a rational Spirit. Even ſo all real and true Chriſtians live and move in a Divine Life, by Vertue of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, which is the very Life and Vertue of Jeſus our <hi>Emanuel;</hi> which Vertue was in him, in ſuch exceeding Fulneſs, that from his ſacred Body Vertue iſſued out, to cure by touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the Impediments of Nature; for by touching, <hi>He cleanſed the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, drave away the Fever,</hi>

                     <hi>Heb.</hi>
11.33.</note> Therefore, in ancient Times, when Faith in the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Holy Men of God, was ſtrong and famous, ſo accordingly their Souls were poſſeſſed with great Degrees of Vertue, by which they wrought many famous Miracles,<note place="margin">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44357:75"/>Miracles, are for the moſt part ceaſed, and Piety doth but meanly flouriſh. Therefore <hi>Bethania,</hi> who is poor in Spirit, is letting out her whole Heart and Soul to Chriſt,<note place="margin">
